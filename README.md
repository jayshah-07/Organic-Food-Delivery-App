This app is designed to help local organic farmers sell their harvest.  It connects them with local restaurants and chefs.  It also allows users to receive notifications on upcoming seasonal items.  This would allow the user to have access to the fresh, locally-grown and in season fruits, vegetables and meats.  

This project makes use of the MERN stack along with Firebase.

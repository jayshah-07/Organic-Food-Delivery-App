This is organic food delivery app created with React and Firebase.  It makes use of React hooks as well as CSS Grid.  It allows the user to create a profile, create orders and the app automatically calculates the tax and other charges.  It uses the Stripe API to receive payments and a receipt is sent to both the user and the restaurant at the end of the transaction.  The users favorite orders are recorded into a database where the data can be used by the business owner to improve customer relations and communication.  I'm planning to add a reward system to this app, similar to the Chik-fil-a mobile app.  

Please view on a laptop.  I am still working on the mobile version.
